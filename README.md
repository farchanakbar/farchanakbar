 Hello, I'm Farchan Akbar. I graduated from Dinamika Bangsa University and have expertise in application development using Flutter. I have studied for over a year to deepen my knowledge of the Dart and Flutter programming languages. I am experienced in using the GetX framework for Flutter state management, and I also have knowledge of other state management approaches such as Bloc and Riverpod. Additionally, I have expertise in frontend web development using the JavaScript language with the ReactJS framework. I have also studied machine learning using the Python programming language, learning to predict data in the form of linear or classification using CSV data, and learning deep learning using TensorFlow and Keras. I have also used transfer learning to predict images.
